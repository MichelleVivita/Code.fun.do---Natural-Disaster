# Code.fun.do---Natural-Disaster Idea 
The National Disaster Management Authority of India classifies Urban Flooding as a natural disaster. Proliferating human population coupled with unplanned urbanization has drastically altered the drainage characteristics of natural catchments, or drainage areas, by increasing the volume and rate of surface runoff. Drainage systems cannot cope with the increasing volume of water and are often encountered with the blockage due to indiscriminate disposal of solid wastes. Hence overflowing drainage systems is also a cause of Urban Flooding. In addition to this, the maintenance of these structures in India is very poor and the capabilities of these utilities decrease over time due to age and ill maintenance.
To predict and contain this natural disaster I have come up with a solution using Neural Networks. We can establish a relationship between the amount of rainfall and the flow into the drains. Other factors to be considered include the age of the sewers, quality of the sewers, the area where the sewers are present. One can train a model to predict the likelihood of there being a possible flood. If the waters are predicted to reach above a certain level, warnings and evacuation calls will be sent out immediately. The possible red alert areas in that city/region is highlighted on the map and this will be studied and acted upon by the Disaster Management Authority.
